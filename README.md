A Visual Studio code extension that allows you to easily navigate between the nearest brackets and quotation marks in the source code.

This extension is highly inspired by [jump-brackets](https://github.com/syovchev/jump-brackets).

Main differences to the "jump-brackets" extension:

- Heavily refactored
- Fixed bugs
- Removed selection feature

## Usage

- `hop-brackets.forward` Go to next bracket or quotes.
- `hop-brackets.backwards` Go to previous bracket or quotes.

ℹ️ No default keybindings are provided by this extension - you'll have to bind the commands yourself.

## Requirements

VS Code version >= 1.75.0
